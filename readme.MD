Lean Canvas is a template for a single page lean business plan,
adapted from the 'Business Model Canvas' created by Alexander 
Osterwald by Ash Maurya in the 'Lean Startup' style.  Planvas
is a Lean Canvas template in markdown that compiles to HTML.

## Motivation
The use case is technical co-founders that want to collaborate
on Github.

## Code Example

    $ cp lean-template.MD your-canvas.md
    $ vim your-canvas.md
    $ node plan2html.js your-canvas.md
    Converting your-canvas.md to HTML.
    Saved as your-canvas.md.html
